description: A chemist, a radio engineer, and a beautiful young woman appear to be
  the only people in the world who have survived a strange attack or epidemic that
  has stopped humanity in its tracks. It appears that human beings' sense of time
  has been obliterated, causing everyone to lapse into a deep trance-like state. Can
  the surviving trio figure out what's happening and reverse it before it's too late?
